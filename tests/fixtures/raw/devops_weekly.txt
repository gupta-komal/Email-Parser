DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #137 - 18th August 2013

I'm in San Francisco this coming week for PuppetConf. If anyone is around=
 and wants to meetup let me know at @garethr on Twitter. If I've got the t=
iming right next weeks issue should be written from San Francisco airport=
=2C if not it might be late Monday for the next instalment of Devops Weekl=
y.

A quick correction from last week. The email to get in touch with Paul if=
 you=E2=80=99re interested in mentoring in New York should have been pnasr=
at@gmail.com.

News
=3D=3D=3D=3D

Good post about the benefits and technicalities of building a continuous d=
elivery pipeline. Some useful diagrams about tooling=2C  I was particularl=
y interesting in the automation of a confidence score for canary builds.

http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/08/deploying-netflix-api.html


A nice post entitled Production is all that matters. Goes into quite a bit=
 of detail about why logging=2C statistics collection and and error handli=
ng are important from a developers point of view.

http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/06/16/production-is-all-that-matters.=
html


Ease of deployment is a nice property of any software=2C and this post exp=
lains why Go makes building software without dependencies easy=2C and why=
 that makes it perfect for systems administration and automation.

http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2013/08/11/go-for-system-administrators/


A tale of scaling log processing at Travis CI. Lots of thorny problems and=
 how to solve them=2C focusing on the importance of ordering and database=
 design.

http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2013-08-08-solving-the-puzzle-of-scalable-=
log-processing/


A nice collection of 14 short interviews from a range of people on the top=
ic of how devops and application security fit together.

http://trustedsoftwarealliance.com/resources-surveys-and-papers/devops-and=
-application-security-infographic/


I=E2=80=99ve seen quite a bit of interest recently about measuring communi=
ty engagement. This post pulls lots of numbers from the Chef community=2C=
 in particular showing the growth of the Chef community cookbooks site and=
 mailing list and IRC chatter.

FuzzDB is an open source database of attack patterns=2C predictable resour=
ce names=2C  regex patterns for identifying interesting server responses=
=2C and documentation resources from Mozilla. Useful for anyone building s=
ecurity tooling.

Events
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Devops days is coming to Atlanta on October 3rd and 4th at the Academy of=
 Medicine at Georgia Tech. Tickets are already on sale and the programme s=
hould be announced soon.

Tools
=3D=3D=3D=3D

If you=E2=80=99re like me you often have several Vagrant managed boxes aro=
und for different projects. The vagrant global status plugin might therefo=
re be useful=2C it tracks all your vagrant machines state=2C making it eas=
ier to track which boxes are currently running.

https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-global-status


Marelle is a new configuration management and systems administration frame=
work written in Prolog. It=E2=80=99s not designed to be as large as Chef o=
r Puppet=2C but the logic based programming approach is certainly interest=
ing.

http://larsyencken.github.io/marelle/


Lots of tooling around docker at the moment. Maestro allows for describing=
 multiple docker containers and their dependencies=2C and then managing th=
em via a simple command line interface.

https://github.com/toscanini/maestro


Vegeta is a command line load testing tool written in Go. It allows you to=
 specify a constant request rate=2C and can output results as text or SVG.=
 The interface is certainly simpler than similar tools like ab or httperf.

https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta


Nginx is an incredibly useful and powerful piece of software=2C but I find=
 you often want to roll your own packages to include one module or another=
=2E This omnibus installer helps with automating building those packages=2C=
 and already includes lots of nginx modules including the openresty distri=
bution.
